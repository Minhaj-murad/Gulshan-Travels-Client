# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview:
  
  1. This project is designed for a travel agencies who wished to provide services for exploring Canada with better hotel amenities.

  2.While doing this project,i for the first time use MongoDB as a server side document database.I also experienced how to create a Database,Database Access,Database Collection and how o connect MongoDB with my server.
  
  3.I also learned CRUD operation while doing this project.Through POST,PATCH,GET,DELETE method i also witnessed the beauty of How to Create a data, How to Read a data ,How to Update and Delete Data.

  4.I also used Google Auth and Email and Password Verification method for creating simple authentication .

  5.PrivateRoute is also being used for Addhotel and MyReviews Section.One cannot access to these section without log in .He/she cannot add his/her own reviews as well as add a new hotel.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
